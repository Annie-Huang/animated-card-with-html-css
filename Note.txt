Don't use <i class="fas fa-user"></i> for font-icon now.

Should use it as pseduo-element describe in
https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/css-pseudo-elements

    font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
    //font-weight: 400; // 400 will go to the Regular version rather than Solid version
    font-weight: 900;
    content: "\f007";

Notice the font-weight represent different version of a icon:
Solid | Regular | Light etc
